# Redux MONSTER(Modularized redux OwN STate reducER)
A proposal for modularization ecosystem for sets of redux child reducers, redux action creators and redux child state selectors.

This proposal tries to achieve following goals:

1. Pack child reducers, action creators, and child state selectors and modularize them.
2. Provide type safety to reduce typos and speed up development jobs.

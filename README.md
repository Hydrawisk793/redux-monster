# Redux MONSTER(Modularized redux OwN STate reducER)
A proposal for modularization ecosystem of packages of redux action types, redux action creators and redux child reducers that manipulates their own state.

This proposal is to fulfill following requirements:

1. Pack action types, action creators and child reducers and modularize them.
2. Prefix action types so that users can create multiple instances of same kind of modules on runtime.
3. Provide type safety to reduce typos and speed up development jobs.
